# Precision Calculator

A responsive calculator web app built with **TypeScript** and **Vite**. It started as a frontend school assignment and was later modernized into a cleaner, production-minded codebase with keyboard support, separated calculation logic, and automated tests.

## Background

This repository began in March 2023 as **FE22 JavaScript 2 — Mini Project 4** (`FE22-js2-mp4`), a coursework calculator built with TypeScript and Parcel. It was **not** a final thesis project (`slutprojekt`) and **not** part of JavaScript 1 — the original repo name and README used the `js2` / `mp4` course naming convention.

The current version is a ground-up rebuild that keeps the same core idea while improving structure, tooling, accessibility, and deployment.

```

## Deployment

The app is deployed on **Netlify** from the `main` branch:

- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Publish directory:** `dist`

`netlify.toml` in the repo defines these settings. GitHub Pages is no longer used for this project.

## Testing

```bash
npm run test
```

Tests cover the calculator engine (`src/calculator.test.ts`) independently of DOM code.
